This project was done using React for frontend, toghether with tailwindcss as CSS framework. And the backend using Firebase services.

The user can sign in, sign out, create, view, save, edit, delete posts, that contain a title, description, the date, the author, and an image that aÂ¡can be uploaded locally.

Next features to implement: comments system and finish the bookmarked page.

- Comments system done

## Description

I didn't see necessary uthe use of Redux because there is a short amout of pieces of State, and very few actions.
Using tailwindcss for simplicity of setting-up, customization, and responsiveness.

About Firebase services, I used Email/Password authentication, Firestore instead of RealTime DB because I already have React listening for the changes.
Storage to upload all the files, and Hosting to deploy it.
